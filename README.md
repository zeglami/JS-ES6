ECMAScript (or ES) is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International[European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)].It was created to standardize JavaScript to help foster multiple independent implementations. JavaScript has remained the most widely used implementation of ECMAScript since the standard wasfirst published, with other implementations including JScript and ActionScript. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.
